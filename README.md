# Mod_2_Project
What factors predict political support in the 2016 presidential election?  I used census data by county as predictor variables and Donald Trump vote proportion by county as the dependent variable.  I downloaded the data in various csvs and merged the resulting dfs into a master df.  I used Seaborn for EDA, Statsmodels for Linear Regression and Lasso for Feature Selection.
